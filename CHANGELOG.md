## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Support for adding labels by setting `labels`
- Check for existing pull request and `created` action output

## [1.1.0] - 2021-06-16

### Added

- Git hook to make sure we always run `yarn build` before committing any Typescript changes. This should prevent dist/index.js from getting out of date.
- Support for setting a proxy using the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable
- Support for GitHub Enterprise by reading `process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY`

### Fixed

- action.yml suggested to use `github-token` as the input where as in reality, we are looking for an input `github_token` (note the underscore!)

## [1.0.0] - 2020-02-15

### Added

- Initial release!
